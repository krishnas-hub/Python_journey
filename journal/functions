"Basically functions are used to seperate code."

A function is a block of reusable code that:
#Does a specific task
#Runs only when called
#Helps avoid repetition and keeps code clean

There are two types of functions in python :
1)Built in function (for eg.print(),len(),type(),sum())
2)User defined function (denoted by def )

There are arguments in python : Arguments are the values you pass to a function when you call it.
for eg: def add(a, b):   # a, b → parameters
    return a + b

 add(3, 4)        # 3, 4 → arguments

#There are 4 types of arguments
